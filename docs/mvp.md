### Main problem

Manually creating high-quality educational flashcards is time-consuming, which discourages people from using an effective learning method such as spaced repetition.

### Minimum feature set (MVP)

* AI-based flashcard generation from provided text (copy–paste)
* Manual flashcard creation
* Browsing, editing, and deleting flashcards
* A simple user account system for storing flashcards
* Integration of flashcards with an existing spaced repetition algorithm

### Out of scope for the MVP

* A proprietary, advanced spaced repetition algorithm (such as SuperMemo or Anki)
* Importing multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
* Sharing flashcard sets between users
* Integrations with other educational platforms
* Mobile applications (initially web-only)

### Success criteria

* 75% of AI-generated flashcards are accepted by the user
* Users create 75% of flashcards using AI
