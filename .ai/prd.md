# PRD – 10x-cards

## 1. Product overview

The 10x-cards project aims to enable users to quickly create and manage sets of educational flashcards. The application uses LLM models (via API) to generate flashcard suggestions
based on provided text.

## 2. User problem

Manually creating high-quality flashcards requires a significant amount of time and effort, which discourages users from adopting an effective learning method such as spaced
repetition. The goal of the solution is to reduce the time needed to create appropriate questions and answers and to simplify the process of managing learning materials.

## 3. Functional requirements

1. Automatic flashcard generation:
   - The user pastes any text (e.g., a textbook excerpt).
   - The application sends the text to an LLM model via an API.
   - The LLM model proposes a set of flashcards (questions and answers).
   - Flashcards are presented to the user as a list with options to accept, edit, or reject them.

2. Manual flashcard creation and management:
   - A form for manually creating flashcards (front and back).
   - Options to edit and delete existing flashcards.
   - Manual creation and display within the “My flashcards” list view.

3. Basic authentication and user account system:
   - Registration and login.
   - Ability to delete the account and associated flashcards upon request.

4. Integration with a spaced repetition algorithm:
   - Providing a mechanism to assign flashcards to a review schedule (using an existing algorithm).
   - No additional metadata or advanced notification features in the MVP.

5. Storage and scalability:
   - Flashcard and user data stored in a way that ensures scalability and security.

6. Flashcard generation statistics:
   - Collecting information on how many flashcards were generated by AI and how many were ultimately accepted.

7. Legal requirements and constraints:
   - Personal data of users and flashcards stored in compliance with GDPR.
   - The right to access and delete data (account along with flashcards) at the user’s request.

## 4. Product boundaries

1. Out of scope for the MVP:

    * An advanced, proprietary spaced repetition algorithm (we use an existing solution, an open-source library).
    * Gamification mechanisms.
    * Mobile applications (currently web-only).
    * Importing multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
    * A publicly available API.
    * Sharing flashcards between users.
    * An advanced notification system.
    * Advanced flashcard search by keywords.

## 5. User stories

ID: US-001
Title: Account registration
Description: As a new user, I want to register so that I can access my own flashcards and use AI-powered flashcard generation.
Acceptance criteria:
- The registration form contains fields for email address and password.
- After correct form submission and data verification, the account is activated.
- The user receives confirmation of successful registration and is logged in.

ID: US-002
Title: Application login
Description: As a registered user, I want to be able to log in so that I can access my flashcards and generation history.
Acceptance criteria:
- After entering valid login credentials, the user is redirected to the flashcard generation view.
- Incorrect login credentials display an error message.
- Login-related data is stored securely.

ID: US-003
Title: Flashcard generation using AI
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to paste a piece of text and generate flashcard suggestions using a button, so that I can save time on manually creating questions and
answers.
Acceptance criteria:
- The flashcard generation view contains a text field where the user can paste their text.
- The text field accepts between 1,000 and 10,000 characters.
- After clicking the generate button, the application communicates with the LLM API and displays a list of generated flashcard proposals for user approval.
- In case of API issues or no response from the model, the user sees an appropriate error message.

ID: US-004
Title: Reviewing and approving flashcard proposals
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to review generated flashcards and decide which ones to add to my set, so that I keep only useful questions and answers.
Acceptance criteria:
- The list of generated flashcards is displayed below the generation form.
- Each flashcard has a button allowing it to be approved, edited, or rejected.
- After approving selected flashcards, the user can click a save button to add them to the database.

ID: US-005
Title: Editing manually created and AI-generated flashcards
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to edit created or generated flashcards to correct potential errors or adjust questions and answers to my needs.
Acceptance criteria:
- There is a list of saved flashcards (both manually created and approved generated ones).
- Each flashcard can be clicked to enter edit mode.
- Changes are saved to the database upon confirmation.

ID: US-006
Title: Deleting flashcards
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to delete unnecessary flashcards to keep my set organized.
Acceptance criteria:
- Each flashcard in the list (in the “My flashcards” view) has a delete option.
- After selecting delete, the user must confirm the action before the flashcard is permanently removed.
- Flashcards are permanently deleted from the database after confirmation.

ID: US-007
Title: Manual flashcard creation
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to manually create a flashcard (by defining the front and back) so that I can add my own material that does not come from automatically
generated content.
Acceptance criteria:
- In the “My flashcards” view, there is a button to add a new flashcard.
- Clicking the button opens a form with “Front” and “Back” fields.
- After saving, the new flashcard appears on the list.

ID: US-008
Title: Study session with spaced repetition algorithm
Description: As a logged-in user, I want added flashcards to be available in a “Study session” view based on an external algorithm, so that I can study effectively (spaced
repetition).
Acceptance criteria:
- In the “Study session” view, the algorithm prepares a flashcard study session.
- Initially, the front of the flashcard is displayed; through interaction, the user reveals the back.
- The user rates how well they have learned the flashcard according to the algorithm’s expectations.
- The algorithm then presents the next flashcard in the study session.

ID: US-009
Title: Secure access and authorization
Description: As a logged-in user, I want to be sure that my flashcards are not accessible to other users, in order to maintain privacy and data security.
Acceptance criteria:
- Only the logged-in user can view, edit, and delete their flashcards.
- There is no access to other users’ flashcards and no sharing functionality.

## 6. Success metrics

1. Flashcard generation effectiveness:
   - 75% of AI-generated flashcards are accepted by users.
   - Users create at least 75% of flashcards using AI (relative to all newly added flashcards).

2. Engagement:
   - Monitoring the number of generated flashcards and comparing it with the number approved to analyze quality and usefulness.
